# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, 
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior 
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, 
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions 
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing the community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by community leaders.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported 
to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at SpaceYaTech. 
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
